Extracted visual, audio, text, and user attribute features. Encoded the features into latent variables using MLP and Bayesian expert products, then decoded them to predict video popularity.<br> - Proposed to construct a comprehensive content quality evaluation system for short videos based on the prediction results, providing targeted recommendations for improving and optimizing short videos, with the goal of enhancing their overall quality and value.<br> - Currently, the short video popularity prediction model has been successfully constructed, and a multimodal popularity dataset based on the BiiBili video website has been built. The popularity prediction model has also achieved ideal results on the BiiBili dataset. |

Evaluated the model’s performance, demonstrating a good comprehensive detection performance in the dataset.<br> - Compared the performance of YOLOv5 with the classic detection models Fast-R-CNN and SSD. Discussed and compared the characteristics of the three models in terms of performance metrics, dataset adaptability, model structure, and inference rate, strengthening the understanding of the three classic object detection models. |
